Knots! is a dynamic website created for a college HTMl and CSS class.
It features five HTML pages along with a variety of images that are animated within the pages.
I chose this topic due to my background in incident response.

About: This page contains all the necessary and minimal information for a new programmer to use. It also links back to the main page.

Basic knots: This page features the most basic knots - the building blocks of knot tying. They illustrate the fundamental principles of knot tying. It also contains the images I used.

Climbing: This page was created with outdoorsmen in mind. This page features knots for climbers, rescue workers, arborists, tower-climbers, and others who use ropes in man-carrying applications.

Knots! Main Page: This is the primary hub of the website. It also features a section dedicated to teaching site users how to tie their tie. I created this page with the intention of enabling daily updates. 

Search and Rescue: Reliability and safety. This page is dedicated to teaching you how to tie survival knots for outdoor and bushcraft activities.

I cannot stress this enough. I created this website within four weeks. Therefore, there are some more edits to come. However, I do urge beginner programmers to take a look and see if there is anything they can learn or use!
